# Intrusion-Detection-using-FBG-Sensors
Fiber Bragg Grating optical fiber is widely used to detect strain and temperature. Immunity to Electromagnetic Interference improves the precision of the result and enables its application into different areas. Optisystem is used to observe strain and temperature parameters of FBG Sensor. SingleMode FBG sensor having 1550Âµm wavelength is implemented for usage due to high immunization to EMI and lowered attenuation rate.The shift in wavelength when strain is experienced by FBG has also been analysed. The level of accuracy and delivery mode are taken into consideration.The results exemplify full capability to acquire strain and temperature parameters exclusively. A rational linear relationship between wavelength shift of optical fiber and strain applied over it shows the sensitivity of FBG for strain. This property of FBG can be used for intrusion detection in remote areas.
